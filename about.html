<h1><font color="teal">About Jen's kitchen</font></h1>
<p>The recipes listed here are the ones that I developed myself.In some cases,I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine,but overtime,I've adapted it enough to call it my own.<i>Bon Appetit</i></p>
<p>The site also includes links to my favourite online cooking resources.One day,I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews. </p>
<p>If you have any recommendations,feel free to email me at jen@example.com.</p>
